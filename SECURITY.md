# Security

Please do not report security issues through GitHub; instead, send an email to
<alex@alexrp> with all relevant information. You will usually get a response
within a day or two.

Once the issue has been confirmed and a fix implemented, a new release will be
published. This will usually be a patch-level release unless a more significant
major/minor-level release coincides with the fix.
